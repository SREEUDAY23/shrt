        A new way to play the same old game. Hand cricket is a game played by many school kids for fun. It uses the
        concepts of cricket and played with hands. Hand Cricket is a game in which two players show scores on their
        respective fingers. If the scores are equal, the batsman is declared out. Else, the score of the batsman is
        added to the total runs of the batting team.

        About
    </h2>
    <p>
        This game is a tribute to one of our's favorite childhood games Hand Cricket. I have played this game for more
        than
        a decade, and I am pretty sure everyone in the Indian subcontinent would have heard or played this game at
        least
        once. Playing this game in person required a lot of coordination as well as quick mental math to keep track
        of
        runs and wickets, and did I mention that it was fun to play? So to bring back those childhood memories, We
        have
        created the Hand Cricket Website. This game is just like how you used to play it but even better!

    <h2>
        How to play
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you aren't familiar with cricket or hand cricket, I highly suggest you to take a look at the rules of
        cricket
        and hand cricket at the bottom of this page. Go on, I am waiting. Now that you have read about the rules (if
        you
        still haven't , READ IT) and know all about wickets, overs and runs , let's get started. Okay, okay for the
        people who are too lazy, let me explain it briefly.

    <ul>
        <li> Runs- This is a unit of scoring. Basically like 'points' for people with no cricketing background.
        </li>
        <li> Wickets- This is a really good way to prevent opponents from scoring. If you pick all the wickets, then the
            opponent can't score any runs.</li>
        <li>
            Overs- This is a limiting factor for the game. If you don't get all the wickets of the opponent, the only
            thing
            that stops the opponent from scoring is the overs. When the opponent has completed batting all the overs,
            they
            can't score anymore. An over has 6 balls and you can choose the number of overs you want to play in Hand
            Cricket.</li>
    </ul>


    <ul>
        Let's say you picked 1 wicket and 1 over in the previous page. You have choosen even and the coin flipped
        and it
        landed as a odd(if compter selects to bowl first). This means that you are going to score first. You clicked
        on
        the play button and now you're on the playing screen. Go ahead and click 5 (ü§ö). If the computer played
        something other than 5 like 1 (‚òùÔ∏è), then you scored 5 runs which will be displayed in the 'Score-Card'
        region.
        Your score on the scoreboard is '5-0' right now. 5 representing the runs scored, and 0 for the number of
        wickets
        lost. Let's say you put a 6 (üëç) and the computer put 2 (‚úåÔ∏è), then you scored 6 more runs. Now your total on
        the
        score board is 11-0 and you have played 0.2 overs out of 1 over. Remember an over has 6 balls so you have 4
        more
        balls left. Let's say you put a ‚òùÔ∏è and the computer also put ‚òùÔ∏è. You lose your wicket because both put the
        same
        number. Now, since you were only playing a 1 wicket game, you have lost all your wickets and your turn to
        score
        runs is overs. Now, on the playing screen, you can see that there is a target of 12 on the screen (your
        score +
        1). This is the number of runs computer needs to win. So now, it is your time to bowl and computer's time to
        bat. The computer randomly plays 1,1,1,2,4,1 while you bowl 6,6,6,4,5,2. If you sum up the computer's runs,
        you
        get 10 (1+1+1+2+4+1). Good job Kevin! The computer cannot score anymore runs now because all the overs are
        completed. As you can see, you scored 11-1 in 0.3 overs and computed scored 10-0 in 1 over. This means that
        you
        won by 1 run!

        If in this example, the computer ended up scoring 12-0 in 1 over, it would win. If computer scored 9-1 in 1
        over, it would lose. If the computer scored 11-0 or 11-1 in 1 over, then the match would be tied. Phew! That
        was
        a long explanation, but if you have followed me right through the end, then you should be good enough to get
        started.
